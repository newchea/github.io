# added journey.c to share my story of learning coding with GitHub
// This C program tells the story of how I started coding using just my phone
// and eventually learned how to use GitHub for real-world projects.

    printf("I explored basic web technologies like HTML and CSS.\n");

    // Finding GitHub
    printf("Then I discovered GitHub.\n");
    printf("At first, it was confusing: branches, commits, repos...\n");
    printf("But I kept learning, step by step.\n\n");

    // What GitHub helped me do
    printf("GitHub became my coding notebook and portfolio.\n");
    printf("I created my first repository and uploaded my HTML project.\n");
    printf("Then I learned how to use GitHub Pages to publish my website!\n\n");

    // The impact
    printf("Now, GitHub is part of my daily coding routine.\n");
    printf("I push changes, review code, and share my work with the world.\n\n");

    // Final thoughts
    printf("My journey proves that you don't need a computer to start.\n");
    printf("Just a phone, a goal, and the courage to try.\n");
    printf("This is only the beginning!\n");
